###  Our Problem Statement😎



## Problem Statement ID - PYS103!

Landslides cause significant destruction, often burying people under debris and making rescue operations extremely challenging. Traditional methods are time-consuming and ineffective for deep or unstable terrain.
To design an IoT based system for Real-time detection and communication to rescue landslide victims!


## Overview


Our project uses seismic sensor(ADXL345 accelerometer) to detect human movement underground. This enables us to check whether the person is alive or not. The Arduino MKR WAN 1310 collects seismic data and transmits it via LoRa to AWS for real-time analysis. Rescue team access the data from AWS cloud and using the location of the device they can rescue victims based on priority(number of person alive).

# HI 👋🏻 WE ARE THE TEAM ETERNALS 🌍





###  Our Problem Statement😎



## Problem Statement ID - PYS103!

Landslides cause significant destruction, often burying people under debris and making rescue operations extremely challenging. Traditional methods are time-consuming and ineffective for deep or unstable terrain.
To design an IoT based system for Real-time detection and communication to rescue landslide victims!


## Overview


Our project uses seismic sensor(ADXL345 accelerometer) and the microwave sensors to detect human movement underground. This enables us to check whether the person is alive or not and the depth of the person burried and the count of the persons. The ESP32  microcontroller can  collects seismic data and transmits it via LoRa to firebase for real-time analysis. Rescue team access the data from Firebase cloud and using the location of the device they can rescue victims based on priority(number of person alive).
